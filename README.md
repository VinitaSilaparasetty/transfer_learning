# Classification of bird species using ViT for transfer learning
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was able to achive a test accuracy of 99% with an average weighted f1score of 99%.

The ViT is a visual model based on the architecture of a transformer originally designed for text-based tasks. The ViT model represents an input image as a series of image patches, like the series of word embeddings used when using transformers to text, and directly predicts class labels for the image.
